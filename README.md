# Exploratory-Factor-Analysis
Data with large number of measured variables have the possibility of having some variables to “overlap” due to its inherent dependency. Factor Analysis (FA) is an exploratory data analysis method used to search influential underlying factors or latent variables from a set of observed variables. It is a method for investigating whether a number of variables of interest Y1, Y2,……., Yl, are linearly related to a smaller number of unobservable factors F1, F2,..……, Fk.

## The Factor Analysis Model
Factor analysis can statistically explain the variance among the observed variable and condense a set of the observed variable into the unobserved variable called factors. Observed variables are modeled as a linear combination of factors and error terms. Each factor explains a particular amount of variance in the observed variables and can help in data interpretations by reducing the number of variables.
